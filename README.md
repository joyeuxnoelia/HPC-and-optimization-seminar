# HPC-and-optimization-seminar

We explore how to use Scalene, a profiler that provides insights into the resource usage of our jobs. We explain how to use SLURM on the Proteus cluster to efficiently submit jobs to different nodes and GPUs. Finally, we explain how to use an optimized high-performance quantum circuit simulator, QSim, on a heterogenous cluster on multi-CPUs and GPUs.
